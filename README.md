Artificial Neural Networks
============

This is an assortment of miscellaneous scripts, programs, and datasets that deal with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
Over the course of my dissertation work, I assembled the items in this repository to learn, break, and understand how
ANNs work and what you can (and cannot) do with them.  Some of the code here was used to build solutions and sketches
for class assignments.

Most of the scripts in this repository are implementations in Python 3, or R.  Some bash scripts are peppered around 
that serve as driver routines, or test cases, for a specific problem; but for the most part the solution implementations
are in either Python or R.

Visualizations are in either MatPlotLib or GGPlot, depending on the main language and task.


## How To Get Started

- [Download the Code](https://github.com/camilo-v/Neural-Networks) and follow the standard instructions on how to 
install the framework/library.

## Communication

- If you **found a bug**, open an issue and _please provide detailed steps to reliably reproduce it_.
- If you have **feature request**, open an issue.
- If you **would like to contribute**, please submit a pull request.

## Requirements

The basic requirements for the software are:

- Python 3, version 3.6.1.
- R, version 3.3.1.

You will need a reasonably modern computer and operating system that can support the above.
